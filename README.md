# Emotion Detection using CNN & OpenCV

## Overview
This project implements an emotion detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OpenCV.  
The model is trained to classify facial expressions into multiple emotion categories such as **Happy, Sad, Angry, and Neutral**.  

## Features
- Real-time facial expression recognition using a webcam.
- Preprocessing with OpenCV (face detection and image augmentation).
- Deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras.
- Visualization of training accuracy and loss.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib**

## Dataset
- The model was trained on the [FER-2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013), a widely used benchmark dataset for facial emotion recognition.

## Results
- Achieved competitive accuracy on validation data.
- Demonstrated robust performance in real-time testing using a webcam.
